# School_Mgmt_System
Registry with students and their grades. 

It starts by adding basic subjects (Maths, Geography, English, Physics and Biology) and adds 3 students with randomly generated grades.

Functionality:
You can add/remove a student and add/change/remove a grade - the system takes grades from 0 to 6 (Polish grading system, 1 being the worst, 6 the best and 0 when the student was absent). 
You can also extract the registry as a file (just change the path in View.java)
